## 🌍 Geospatial & Remote Sensing Projects

### [Environmental Impact on Cardiovascular Diseases in Nairobi](/cvd_undergraduate_project/){: .btn .btn--primary}
*Geospatial Analysis | Remote Sensing | Public Health Research*

Integrated satellite data (Sentinel-5P, Sentinel-2) with GIS analysis to examine relationships between air pollution, greenspaces, and CVD prevalence in Nairobi County. Employed Google Earth Engine, R, and ArcGIS for spatial correlation and linear regression modeling.

**Technologies**: Google Earth Engine, R, ArcGIS, Sentinel-5P TROPOMI, Sentinel-2 MSI  

**Key Results**: Identified spatial patterns in NO₂ and CO pollution, mapped greenspace disparities, developed predictive model (R² = 0.31)
