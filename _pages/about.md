I am an innovative and results-driven Geospatial Engineer with a passion for leveraging data, technology, and spatial intelligence to address environmental and development challenges. I hold a Bachelor of Engineering in Geospatial Engineering from the Technical University of Kenya (Upper Second-Class Honors) and have strong expertise in GIS analysis, remote sensing, and environmental mapping.

Currently, I am enhancing my technical foundation through the AWS re/Start Program, where I’m gaining hands-on experience in cloud computing, Linux, networking, and AWS services. This training complements my growing interest in data science, where I aim to apply machine learning, data analytics, and cloud technologies to extract insights from spatial and environmental data.

My long-term goal is to become a data-driven geospatial professional and future data scientist, contributing to sustainable development, environmental conservation, and evidence-based decision-making across Africa and beyond.
