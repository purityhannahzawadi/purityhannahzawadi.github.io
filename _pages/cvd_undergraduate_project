## Project Overview

This undergraduate research project investigated the relationships between environmental factors and cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevalence in Nairobi County, Kenya. Using a multi-platform geospatial workflow combining satellite remote sensing, GIS analysis, and statistical modeling, the study examined how air pollution and greenspace accessibility relate to CVD incidence rates across different neighborhoods.

### Background & Motivation

Cardiovascular diseases account for 32% of global deaths, with disproportionate impacts in low- and middle-income regions. In Kenya, CVDs represent approximately 25% of hospital admissions with a 13% mortality rate. While individual risk factors like genetics and lifestyle are well-studied, the role of environmental exposures—particularly in African urban contexts—remains underexplored.

Nairobi, experiencing rapid urbanization (4% annual population growth), faces significant environmental challenges including air pollution and limited greenspace access. This study aimed to quantify these environmental impacts on cardiovascular health outcomes.

## Methodology

### Data Sources & Tools

**Satellite Data:**
- **Sentinel-5P TROPOMI**: Air quality monitoring (NO₂, CO) at 1113.2m resolution
- **Sentinel-2 MSI**: Land cover and vegetation mapping (NDVI) at 60m resolution
- **World Bank**: Ward-level cardiovascular incidence data

**Analysis Platforms:**
- **Google Earth Engine**: Satellite data retrieval and preprocessing
- **ArcGIS**: Spatial data integration and rasterization
- **R Programming**: Statistical analysis, visualization, and regression modeling

### Workflow

```
1. Data Acquisition (GEE)
   ├── Air pollution layers (NO₂, CO) - 2021-2022
   ├── Greenspace mapping (NDVI)
   └── Cloud filtering and preprocessing

2. Spatial Integration (ArcGIS)
   ├── CVD data import and classification
   ├── Vector to raster conversion
   └── Layer alignment and export

3. Statistical Analysis (R)
   ├── Exploratory data analysis
   ├── Correlation analysis (Pearson's r)
   └── Linear regression modeling
```

### Key Analyses

**Spatial Analysis:**
- Created annual composite maps of air pollutants and greenspace distribution
- Calculated mean exposure levels across the study period
- Mapped CVD incidence patterns by administrative ward

**Statistical Modeling:**
- Pearson correlation analysis between environmental variables and CVD burden
- Multiple linear regression to identify significant predictors
- Model performance evaluation (R², p-values)

## Results & Findings

{% include gallery caption="Spatial distribution maps of environmental variables and CVD incidence" %}

### Air Pollution Patterns

- **NO₂ levels**: Maximum concentration of 44.90 ppb, concentrated in central business district
- **CO levels**: Maximum of 27.32 mg/m³, showing urban concentration patterns
- Both pollutants showed persistent presence across the city despite relatively low absolute levels

### Greenspace Distribution

Analysis revealed greenspaces predominantly located outside the main city center, suggesting unequal access across neighborhoods. NDVI-based classification showed clear spatial disparities in vegetation coverage.

### Correlation Analysis

Key findings from Pearson correlation:
- **CO and Greenspace**: Strong negative correlation (r = -0.42, p < 0.0001) - areas with higher pollution had less greenspace
- **Greenspace and CVD**: Positive correlation (r = 0.22, p = 0.045) - unexpected direction, contrary to previous literature
- **NO₂ and CVD**: Weak positive correlation (r = 0.16, p = 0.15) - not statistically significant

### Regression Results

The linear regression model (R² = 0.31, p < 0.0001) revealed:
- **Greenspace was the only statistically significant predictor** (p < 0.001) of CVD burden
- NO₂ (p = 0.251) and CO (p = 0.635) showed no significant predictive relationships
- The model explained 31% of variation in CVD cases

## Discussion & Implications

### Unexpected Findings

The positive association between greenspace and CVD burden contrasted with established literature. This suggests:

1. **Localized context matters**: Socioeconomic factors may modify greenspace benefits in Nairobi
2. **Access vs. availability**: Presence of greenspace doesn't guarantee utilization
3. **Confounding variables**: Lifestyle choices, diet, and healthcare access may drive patterns

### Public Health Implications

The findings emphasize that CVD interventions in Nairobi require a **multi-faceted approach**:
- Environmental risk mitigation (air quality improvement)
- Lifestyle modification programs
- Socioeconomic equity improvements
- Enhanced healthcare system capacity

### Methodological Contributions

This project demonstrated:
- Successful integration of multiple geospatial platforms (GEE, ArcGIS, R)
- Application of satellite remote sensing for urban health research in African contexts
- Spatial analysis techniques for identifying health disparities at the neighborhood level

## Challenges & Limitations

- **Geographic scope**: Findings specific to Nairobi; may not generalize to other regions
- **Data constraints**: Ward-level CVD estimates may not capture neighborhood-scale variations
- **Temporal scope**: Two-year study period; longer timeframes needed for trend analysis
- **Unmeasured confounders**: Diet, exercise, smoking, and socioeconomic factors not included

## Future Directions

1. **Enhanced modeling**: Incorporate demographic, lifestyle, and healthcare access variables
2. **Qualitative research**: Community engagement to understand greenspace utilization patterns
3. **Longitudinal analysis**: Extended time series to capture temporal trends
4. **Intervention studies**: Test targeted environmental and health system improvements

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

- **Remote Sensing**: Satellite data processing, atmospheric corrections, cloud masking
- **GIS Analysis**: Spatial data integration, rasterization, overlay analysis
- **Statistical Programming**: R for data manipulation, visualization, and modeling
- **Data Visualization**: Creation of publication-quality maps and figures
- **Research Methodology**: Literature review, hypothesis testing, scientific writing

## Project Impact

This research contributes to the limited body of work on environmental drivers of cardiovascular disease in Sub-Saharan Africa. The spatial analysis framework can inform:
- **Urban planning**: Targeted greenspace development in underserved areas
- **Public health policy**: Evidence-based interventions for CVD prevention
- **Future research**: Foundation for expanded studies incorporating additional variables
