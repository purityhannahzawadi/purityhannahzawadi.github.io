**Remotely Run Commands on an EC2 Instance with AWS Systems Manager**

**Project Overview**

A hands-on implementation of AWS Systems Manager to remotely manage EC2 instances without traditional SSH access. This project demonstrates cloud infrastructure management following enterprise security best practices.

**Technologies Used**

AWS Systems Manager - Remote command execution and fleet management

Amazon EC2 - Virtual server instances

AWS IAM - Identity and access management

Amazon Linux - Operating system

Shell Scripting - Automation commands

**Problem Statement**

As a System Administrator, I needed to update packages on EC2 instances while adhering to strict security policies that prohibited:

    ● Direct SSH access to production servers

    ● Use of bastion hosts

    ● Remote PowerShell connections

**Solution Architecture**

The solution leverages AWS Systems Manager's Run Command feature to securely execute administrative tasks on EC2 instances through AWS's managed infrastructure.

**Implementation Walkthrough**

Step 1: Create IAM Role for Systems Manager

First, I created an IAM role that allows EC2 instances to communicate with Systems Manager.
